/*
need to ensure this is only ever run against test redis instances, somehow. Until then manual flushall.
todo: before/after cleanup tasks

Look into:
    weird test failures, from redis response parsing errors deep in scredis.
    These errors have never happened when running the app,
    either on heroku or locally. Investigate further.
    --Hypothesis: generating pubsub messages that get parsed weirdly when no clients are active

  features from case study

  1. set up a user with a unique id and related data
     (GET username:username:uid => if isDefined, error
     INCR global:nextUserId => unique, no sequential guarantee (don't test for order, only uniqueness)
     SET uid:1000:username antirez
     SET uid:1000:password p1pp0
     SET username:antirez:uid 1000

  test: register N users with name and password equal to prefix + iteration #, check that users can be retrieved with same info

  functions
    register_user(username, user_id) => incr uid, use below setter functions
    get/set user_id(username)
    get/set username(user id)
    get/set password



  2. follower/following, posts (of interest to user) (this section only describes data structure, not actions)
    uid:1000:followers => Set of uids of all the followers users
    uid:1000:following => Set of uids of all the following users

    test:
      follow, check following list for follower, followee

    functions:
      follow_user(follower, following)
      get following
      get followers

  make a post
      uid:1000:posts => a List of post ids - every new post is LPUSHed here.
      INCR global:nextPostId => 10343
      SET post:10343 "$owner_id|$time|I'm having fun with Retwis

  distribute a post to recipients
      foreach($followers as $fid) {
        $r->push("uid:$fid:posts",$postid,false);

  fetch posts
    LRANGE uid:1000:posts

  test: have N users follow user a and not user b. users a and b post M messages. check that all messages availible from uid:1000:posts

  function:
    make post (user, post body)
    fetch user posts(user) //single range for now, add pagination later



  3.authentication (test getter/setter, I suppose (also, setter will encapsulate generating a new auth string)
    SET uid:1000:auth fea5e81ac8ca77622bed1c2132a021f9
    SET auth:fea5e81ac8ca77622bed1c2132a021f9 1000

  test: generate and fetch some auth tokens

  functions
    gen_auth_token(user id)
    get user(token)
    get token(user id)
